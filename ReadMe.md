## New wine into old wineskins

<details><summary>Luke 5:37-39</summary><p>37 And no one puts new wine into old wineskins. If he does, the new wine will burst the skins and it will be spilled, and the skins will be destroyed.38 But new wine must be put into fresh wineskins. 39 And no one after drinking old wine desires new, for he says, ‘The old is good.’” <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+5%3A37-39&version=ESV">(ESV)</a></p></details>

### Context

- Jesus is attending a dinner at Levi's house with tax collectors
- He has already told them he has not come for the healthy but for sinners
- He was asked why His disciples don't fast while John's did
- He replied that you do not fast while the bridegroom is present, but that the time will come when the bridegroom is taken from them. Then they will fast.

### Interpretation 1

- Jesus was bringing a new covenant that did not fit with the old rituals and customs of the Pharisees
- Jesus message cut to the heart of the hearer while the Pharisees' customs only dealt with the external
- Preference of old vs. instead of new refers to an adjustment period between for followers of the old ways (e.g. John and his disciples) who will grow into the new ways

- https://hermeneutics.stackexchange.com/questions/7659/what-does-jesus-mean-in-luke-536-39-new-wine-into-old-wineskins

### Interpretation 2

- Old garment and wineskins = Jesus' disciples
- New wine and unshrunk cloth represent the practice of fasting twice a week
- Fasting this way would be burdensome to the new disciples, and would be more than they could bear.
- John Calvin: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Wine_into_Old_Wineskins

## A tree and its fruit

<details><summary>Luke 6:43-45</summary><p>43 “For no good tree bears bad fruit, nor again does a bad tree bear good fruit, 44 for each tree is known by its own fruit. For figs are not gathered from thornbushes, nor are grapes picked from a bramble bush. 45 The good person out of the good treasure of his heart produces good, and the evil person out of his evil treasure produces evil, for out of the abundance of the heart his mouth speaks." <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+6:43-45&version=ESV">(ESV)</a></p></details>

### Context

- Jesus is finishing the "Sermon on the Plain" where he is preaching to his disciples and a crowd that had gathered
- Immediately before this parable, Jesus criticizes hypocrites for seeing the speck in their brother's eye but not the log in their own eyes.
- Immediately following this parable, Jesus asks "Why do you call me 'Lord, Lord,' and not do what I tell you?" and compares those who hear His words but does not do them to a man who builds a house on the ground without a foundation.

### Interpretation

- What we say, how we say it, and when we say it reveals the condition of our heart.
- This passage says that it's a person's *words*, that indicates the condition of their heart. This passage is not talking about actions, but words.
- We should reflect on our words as a way to gauge our own hearts. This passage is not a license to judge others based on their words (see Context above), but focus on our own words.

## Wise and foolish builders

<details><summary>Luke 6:46-49</summary><p>46 “Why do you call me ‘Lord, Lord,’ and not do what I tell you? 47 Everyone who comes to me and hears my words and does them, I will show you what he is like: 48 he is like a man building a house, who dug deep and laid the foundation on the rock. And when a flood arose, the stream broke against that house and could not shake it, because it had been well built. 49 But the one who hears and does not do them is like a man who built a house on the ground without a foundation. When the stream broke against it, immediately it fell, and the ruin of that house was great.” <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=luke+6:46-49&version=ESV">(ESV)</a></p></details>

### Context

- Immediately follows "A tree and its fruit" (above)
- This is the last section of Jesus' "Sermon on the Plain"

### Interpretation

- Jesus is talking to his followers and the people who have come to listen to Him.

- They are already making an effort to listen to Him, but that is not enough.

- Jesus says that those who listen but do not obey are like fools who build a house with no foundation.

- Bible study, church service, theology, small groups are all great, but they alone are not enough. Knowledge is not enough. Religion is not enough. We must be obedient to God's Word.

- <details><summary>James 1:22-23</summary><p>22 But be doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving yourselves.23 For if anyone is a hearer of the word and not a doer, he is like a man who looks intently at his natural face in a mirror. 24 For he looks at himself and goes away and at once forgets what he was like. 25 But the one who looks into the perfect law, the law of liberty, and perseveres, being no hearer who forgets but a doer who acts, he will be blessed in his doing. <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=James%201:22-23&version=ESV">(ESV)</a></p></details>

- <details><summary>James 2:14-17</summary><p>14 What good is it, my brothers, if someone says he has faith but does not have works? Can that faith save him? 15 If a brother or sister is poorly clothed and lacking in daily food, 16 and one of you says to them, “Go in peace, be warmed and filled,” without giving them the things needed for the body, what good is that? 17 So also faith by itself, if it does not have works, is dead. <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=James+2%3A14-17&version=ESV">(ESV)</a></p></details>

## The two debtors

<details><summary>Luke 7:41-43</summary><p>41 “A certain moneylender had two debtors. One owed five hundred denarii, and the other fifty. 42 When they could not pay, he cancelled the debt of both. Now which of them will love him more?” 43 Simon answered, “The one, I suppose, for whom he cancelled the larger debt.” And he said to him, “You have judged rightly.” <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%207:41-43&version=ESV">(ESV)</a></p></details>

### Context

- A Pharisee named Simon invited Jesus to eat at his house.
- As they were eating a  "woman of the city" who "was a sinner" washed Jesus' feet with her tears, wiped them with her hair, and anointed them with her very expensive perfume
- When Simon thought to himself that if Jesus was a prophet, he would have known the woman was a sinner, Jesus told him this parable.
- After telling him the parable, he compared Simon's inaction (did not give Jesus water for his feet, any kisses, or anoint his head) vs. the woman's humble actions.

### Interpretation

- Jesus seems to be teaching Simon to see the woman as he sees her. She is not forgiven much because she love much but rather she loves much because she has been forgiven much.
- 47 "Therefore I tell you, her sins, which are many, are forgiven—for she loved much. But he who is forgiven little, loves little."
- Jesus is saying that love is the proof of forgiven sins.
- He is also demonstrating his prophetic abilities by responding to Simon's unspoken thought.

## The sower

<details><summary>Luke 8:5-8</summary><p>5 “A sower went out to sow his seed. And as he sowed, some fell along the path and was trampled underfoot, and the birds of the air devoured it. 6 And some fell on the rock, and as it grew up, it withered away, because it had no moisture. 7 And some fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up with it and choked it. 8 And some fell into good soil and grew and yielded a hundredfold.” As he said these things, he called out, “He who has ears to hear, let him hear.” <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=luke+8&version=ESV">Luke 8</a></p></details>

### Context

- Jesus was proclaiming the goods news of the kingdom of God in many towns and villages. His disciples were with him. A great crowd had gathered.

- After telling the parable, Jesus explained the purpose of the parables.

  > 9 And when his disciples asked him what this parable meant, 10 he said, “To you it has been given to know the secrets of the kingdom of God, but for others they are in parables, so that ‘seeing they may not see, and hearing they may not understand.’

### Interpretation

- After explaining the purpose of the parables, Jesus himself interprets it for his disciples.

> 11 Now the parable is this: The seed is the word of God. 12 The ones along the path are those who have heard; then the devil comes and takes away the word from their hearts, so that they may not believe and be saved. 13 And the ones on the rock are those who, when they hear the word, receive it with joy. But these have no root; they believe for a while, and in time of testing fall away.14 And as for what fell among the thorns, they are those who hear, but as they go on their way they are choked by the cares and riches and pleasures of life, and their fruit does not mature. 15 As for that in the good soil, they are those who, hearing the word, hold it fast in an honest and good heart, and bear fruit with patience.

- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parable_of_the_Sower

> While in Matthew and Luke, the parable seems to be about the various ways in the which the word of God is received, in Mark, it comes just after a description in the previous chapter of a developing hostility toward Jesus and his ministry. The Pharisees held him suspect for not holding to what they perceived as a strict observance of the Sabbath, by performing various cures. Some schools of thought found such actions permissible only if the person treated were in danger of death.[[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parable_of_the_Sower#cite_note-3) Some of the Jerusalem scribes contended that Jesus derived his power through demonic sources. Even the disciples appear not to understand.
>
> This is then followed by the [Parable of the Growing Seed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parable_of_the_Growing_Seed) and that of [Mustard Seed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parable_of_the_Mustard_Seed). Together they indicate that it is not about the individual's response to his message, or even the apparent failure of it to take root, but that "...in spite of the opposition of enemies of the Kingdom and in spite of the moral and intellectual failings of the Kingdom’s putative friends, the Kingdom will succeed immensely in the end."[[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parable_of_the_Sower#cite_note-4)[[5\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parable_of_the_Sower#cite_note-5) Mark uses it to highlight the effect Christ's previous teachings have had on people as well as the effect the Christian message has had on the world over the three decades between Christ's ministry and the writing of the Gospel.[[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parable_of_the_Sower#cite_note-Kilgallen_p.83-1)

## Lamp under a jar

<details><summary>Luke 8:16-18</summary><p>16 “No one after lighting a lamp covers it with a jar or puts it under a bed, but puts it on a stand, so that those who enter may see the light. 17 For nothing is hidden that will not be made manifest, nor is anything secret that will not be known and come to light. 18 Take care then how you hear, for to the one who has, more will be given, and from the one who has not, even what he thinks that he has will be taken away.”</p></details>

### Context

- This parable immediately follows the parable of the sower and Jesus explanation of the purpose of the parables and of the parable of the sower.
- Immediately after the parable Jesus was told that his mother and brothers were waiting to see him. He replied that "those who hear the word of God and do it" are his mother and brothers.

### Interpretation

- The light could be interpreted as Jesus, his message, or the disciples' response to his message

  - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamp_under_a_bushel

- Since the immediate context both before and after the parable deal with how a person responds to the Word of God, it would logically follow that the meaning of the light in this parable is also the Word of God.

  > First, I look at the immediate context. It is followed by a verse about nothing being hidden (8:17), and a familiar saying "Therefore consider carefully how you listen (Greek *akouo*)" (8:18), very similar to 8:8 in the Parable of the Soils: "He who has ears to hear (*akouo*), let him hear (*akouo*)" (8:8). In fact, the word "to hear" appears many times in the Parable of the Soils.
  >
  > - "He who has ears to **hear**, let him **hear**." (8:8)
  > - "... though **hearing**, they may not understand." (8:10)
  > - "Those along the path are the ones who **hear**..." (8:12)
  > - "Those on the rock are the ones who receive the word with joy when they **hear** it..." (8:13)
  > - "The seed that fell among thorns stands for those who **hear**..." (8:14)
  > - "But the seed on good soil stands for those ... who **hear** the word..." (8:15)
  >
  > The clear theme of the Parable of the Soils is hearing the Word of God, and it appears that this theme stretches from 8:1 where Jesus is traveling from village to city "proclaiming the good news of the kingdom of God" to 8:21 where Jesus says that his true family are those who hear God's Word and do it (8:21).

## The good Samaritan

<details><summary>Luke 10:25-37</summary><p>25 And behold, a lawyer stood up to put him to the test, saying, “Teacher, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?” 26 He said to him, “What is written in the Law? How do you read it?” 27 And he answered, “You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength and with all your mind, and your neighbor as yourself.” 28 And he said to him, “You have answered correctly; do this, and you will live.”29 But he, desiring to justify himself, said to Jesus, “And who is my neighbor?” 30 Jesus replied, “A man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and he fell among robbers, who stripped him and beat him and departed, leaving him half dead. 31 Now by chance a priest was going down that road, and when he saw him he passed by on the other side.32 So likewise a Levite, when he came to the place and saw him, passed by on the other side. 33 But a Samaritan, as he journeyed, came to where he was, and when he saw him, he had compassion. 34 He went to him and bound up his wounds, pouring on oil and wine. Then he set him on his own animal and brought him to an inn and took care of him.35 And the next day he took out two denarii[[c](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=luke+10&version=ESV#fen-ESV-25390c)] and gave them to the innkeeper, saying, ‘Take care of him, and whatever more you spend, I will repay you when I come back.’ 36 Which of these three, do you think, proved to be a neighbor to the man who fell among the robbers?” 37 He said, “The one who showed him mercy.” And Jesus said to him, “You go, and do likewise.” <a href="">Luke 10</a></p></details>

### Context

- The parable appears after the 72 return rejoicing that demons were subject to them. Jesus responds by rejoicing that the Father had hidden the gospel from the wise and understanding and revealed it to young children.
- After the parable, Jesus entered a village where Martha invited him to her house, and then got upset that her sister Mary sat and listened to him rather than help serve.

### Interpretation

- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parable_of_the_Good_Samaritan

> Many see [2Chronicles 28:8–15](https://www.biblica.com/bible/?osis=niv:2chronicles.28:8%E2%80%9328:15) as the model for the Samaritan's neighborly behavior in the parable. In Chronicles, Northern Israelite ancestors of Samaritans treat Judean enemies as fellow-Israelite neighbors.

> [Francis Schaeffer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Schaeffer) suggested: "Christians are not to love their believing brothers to the exclusion of their non-believing fellowmen. That is ugly. We are to have the example of the good Samaritan consciously in mind at all times."

> [Joel B. Green](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joel_B._Green) writes that Jesus' final question (which, in something of a "twist", reverses the question originally asked):
>
>  ... presupposes the identification of "anyone" as a neighbor, then presses the point that such an identification opens wide the door of loving action. By leaving aside the identity of the wounded man and by portraying the Samaritan traveler as one who performs the law (and so as one whose actions are consistent with an orientation to eternal life), Jesus has nullified the worldview that gives rise to such questions as, Who is my neighbor? The purity-holiness matrix has been capsized. And, not surprisingly in the Third Gospel, neighborly love has been concretized in care for one who is, in this parable, self-evidently a social outcast
>
> [Martin Luther King, Jr.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Luther_King,_Jr.) often spoke of this parable, contrasting the rapacious philosophy of the robbers, and the self-preserving non-involvement of the priest and Levite, with the Samaritan's coming to the aid of the man in need. King also extended the call for neighborly assistance to society at large:
>
> On the one hand we are called to play the good Samaritan on life's roadside; but that will be only an initial act. One day we must come to see that the whole Jericho road must be transformed so that men and women will not be constantly beaten and robbed as they make their journey on life's highway. True compassion is more than flinging a coin to a beggar; it is not haphazard and superficial. It comes to see that an edifice which produces beggars needs restructuring.

## The friend at night

<details><summary>Luke 11:5-13</summary><p>5 And he said to them, “Which of you who has a friend will go to him at midnight and say to him, ‘Friend, lend me three loaves, 6 for a friend of mine has arrived on a journey, and I have nothing to set before him’; 7 and he will answer from within, ‘Do not bother me; the door is now shut, and my children are with me in bed. I cannot get up and give you anything’? 8 I tell you, though he will not get up and give him anything because he is his friend, yet because of his impudence[c] he will rise and give him whatever he needs. 9 And I tell you, ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you. 10 For everyone who asks receives, and the one who seeks finds, and to the one who knocks it will be opened. 11 What father among you, if his son asks for[d] a fish, will instead of a fish give him a serpent; 12 or if he asks for an egg, will give him a scorpion? 13 If you then, who are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will the heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him!”<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=luke+11&version=ESV">Luke 11</a></p></details>

### Context

- Jesus tells this parable immediately after teaching his disciples the Lord's prayer when the asked him how to pray.
- It appears right before Luke describes the time when Jesus casts out a demon and some of the people accused him of casting them out by the power of Satan.

### Interpretation

- Since the parable is a part of Jesus response to the disciples' question of how to pray, we should assume the moral is teaching us how we should pray.
- The parable emphasizes the persistence of the friend. Jesus says that the man does not fulfill his friend's wish because they are friends but rather because of his persistence.
- In verse 13, Jesus specifically mentions that God will give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him. It does not say that he'll answer any prayer.
- https://bible.org/seriespage/lesson-54-how-approach-god-luke-115-13

> Jesus’ specifying the Holy Spirit shows that He is not promising to meet our every whim for material things or for earthly benefits. But He is promising that if something is for our spiritual good and we come as trusting children and ask, the loving Father will give it to us. He may delay the blessing because He knows that I am not ready to receive it yet. He may have purposes of training me in faith and prayer that require His withholding the request for the present time. He may know what I do not know, that my request is not for my ultimate good, and so He will deny my request because He has something better for me. But Jesus is teaching that we should approach God with trust, as a child would come to a loving father, and if my request is for my spiritual good, the Father will give it to me. Andrew Murray (p. 37) puts it, “Fatherlike giving is the Divine response to childlike living.”
