# Parables

# New wine into old wineskins

### [Luke 5:37-39](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+5%3A37-39&version=ESV)

### Context

- Jesus is attending a dinner at Levi's house with tax collectors
- He has already told them he has not come for the healthy but for sinners
- He was asked why His disciples don't fast while John's did
- He replied that you do not fast while the bridegroom is present, but that the time will come when the bridegroom is taken from them. Then they will fast.

### Meaning 1

- Jesus was bringing a new covenant that did not fit with the old rituals and customs of the Pharisees
- Jesus message cut to the heart of the hearer while the Pharisees' customs only dealt with the external
- Preference of old vs. instead of new refers to an adjustment period between for followers of the old ways (e.g. John and his disciples) who will grow into the new ways

### Meaning 2

- Old garment and wineskins = Jesus' disciples
- New wine and unshrunk cloth represent the practice of fasting twice a week
