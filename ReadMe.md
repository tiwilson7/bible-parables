## New wine into old wineskins

<details><summary>Luke 5:37-39</summary><p>37 And no one puts new wine into old wineskins. If he does, the new wine will burst the skins and it will be spilled, and the skins will be destroyed.38 But new wine must be put into fresh wineskins. 39 And no one after drinking old wine desires new, for he says, ‘The old is good.’” <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+5%3A37-39&version=ESV">(ESV)</a></p></details>

### Context

- Jesus is attending a dinner at Levi's house with tax collectors
- He has already told them he has not come for the healthy but for sinners
- He was asked why His disciples don't fast while John's did
- He replied that you do not fast while the bridegroom is present, but that the time will come when the bridegroom is taken from them. Then they will fast.

### Interpretation 1

- Jesus was bringing a new covenant that did not fit with the old rituals and customs of the Pharisees
- Jesus message cut to the heart of the hearer while the Pharisees' customs only dealt with the external
- Preference of old vs. instead of new refers to an adjustment period between for followers of the old ways (e.g. John and his disciples) who will grow into the new ways

### Interpretation 2

- Old garment and wineskins = Jesus' disciples
- New wine and unshrunk cloth represent the practice of fasting twice a week
- Fasting this way would be burdensome to the new disciples, and would be more than they could bear.

## A tree and its fruit

<details><summary>Luke 6:43-45</summary><p>43 “For no good tree bears bad fruit, nor again does a bad tree bear good fruit, 44 for each tree is known by its own fruit. For figs are not gathered from thornbushes, nor are grapes picked from a bramble bush. 45 The good person out of the good treasure of his heart produces good, and the evil person out of his evil treasure produces evil, for out of the abundance of the heart his mouth speaks." <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+6:43-45&version=ESV">(ESV)</a></p></details>

### Context

- Jesus is finishing the "Sermon on the Plain" where he is preaching to his disciples and a crowd that had gathered
- Immediately before this parable, Jesus criticizes hypocrites for seeing the speck in their brother's eye but not the log in their own eyes.
- Immediately following this parable, Jesus asks "Why do you call me 'Lord, Lord,' and not do what I tell you?" and compares those who hear His words but does not do them to a man who builds a house on the ground without a foundation.

### Interpretation

- What we say, how we say it, and when we say it reveals the condition of our heart.
- This passage says that it's a person's *words*, that indicates the condition of their heart. This passage is not talking about actions, but words.
- We should reflect on our words as a way to gauge our own hearts. This passage is not a license to judge others based on their words (see Context above), but focus on our own words.

## Wise and foolish builders

<details><summary>Luke 6:46-49</summary><p>46 “Why do you call me ‘Lord, Lord,’ and not do what I tell you? 47 Everyone who comes to me and hears my words and does them, I will show you what he is like: 48 he is like a man building a house, who dug deep and laid the foundation on the rock. And when a flood arose, the stream broke against that house and could not shake it, because it had been well built. 49 But the one who hears and does not do them is like a man who built a house on the ground without a foundation. When the stream broke against it, immediately it fell, and the ruin of that house was great.” <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=luke+6:46-49&version=ESV">(ESV)</a></p></details>

### Context

- Immediately follows "A tree and its fruit" (above)
- This is the last section of Jesus' "Sermon on the Plain"

### Interpretation

- Jesus is talking to his followers and the people who have come to listen to Him.

- They are already making an effort to listen to Him, but that is not enough.

- Jesus says that those who listen but do not obey are like fools who build a house with no foundation.

- Bible study, church service, theology, small groups are all great, but they alone are not enough. Knowledge is not enough. Religion is not enough. We must be obedient to God's Word.

- <details><summary>James 1:22-23</summary><p>22 But be doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving yourselves.23 For if anyone is a hearer of the word and not a doer, he is like a man who looks intently at his natural face in a mirror. 24 For he looks at himself and goes away and at once forgets what he was like. 25 But the one who looks into the perfect law, the law of liberty, and perseveres, being no hearer who forgets but a doer who acts, he will be blessed in his doing. <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=James%201:22-23&version=ESV">(ESV)</a></p></details>

- <details><summary>James 2:14-17</summary><p>14 What good is it, my brothers, if someone says he has faith but does not have works? Can that faith save him? 15 If a brother or sister is poorly clothed and lacking in daily food, 16 and one of you says to them, “Go in peace, be warmed and filled,” without giving them the things needed for the body, what good is that? 17 So also faith by itself, if it does not have works, is dead. <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=James+2%3A14-17&version=ESV">(ESV)</a></p></details>

## The two debtors

<details><summary>Luke 7:41-43</summary><p>41 “A certain moneylender had two debtors. One owed five hundred denarii, and the other fifty. 42 When they could not pay, he cancelled the debt of both. Now which of them will love him more?” 43 Simon answered, “The one, I suppose, for whom he cancelled the larger debt.” And he said to him, “You have judged rightly.” <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%207:41-43&version=ESV">(ESV)</a></p></details>

### Context

- A Pharisee named Simon invited Jesus to eat at his house.
- As they were eating a  "woman of the city" who "was a sinner" washed Jesus' feet with her tears, wiped them with her hair, and anointed them with her very expensive perfume
- When Simon thought to himself that if Jesus was a prophet, he would have known the woman was a sinner, Jesus told him this parable.
- After telling him the parable, he compared Simon's inaction (did not give Jesus water for his feet, any kisses, or anoint his head) vs. the woman's humble actions.

### Interpretation

- Jesus seems to be teaching Simon to see the woman as he sees her. She is not forgiven much because she love much but rather she loves much because she has been forgiven much.
- 47 "Therefore I tell you, her sins, which are many, are forgiven—for she loved much. But he who is forgiven little, loves little."
- Jesus is saying that love is the proof of forgiven sins.
- He is also demonstrating his prophetic abilities by responding to Simon's unspoken thought.
